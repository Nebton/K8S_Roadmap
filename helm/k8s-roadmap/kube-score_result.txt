    [CRITICAL] Container Image Pull Policy
        Â· backend-v1 -> ImagePullPolicy is not set to Always
            It's recommended to always set the ImagePullPolicy to Always, to
            make sure that the imagePullSecrets are always correct, and to
            always get the image you want.
    [CRITICAL] Container Ephemeral Storage Request and Limit
        Â· backend-v1 -> Ephemeral Storage limit is not set
            Resource limits are recommended to avoid resource DDOS. Set
            resources.limits.ephemeral-storage
        Â· backend-v1 -> Ephemeral Storage request is not set
            Resource requests are recommended to make sure the application can
            start and run without crashing. Set
            resource.requests.ephemeral-storage
    [CRITICAL] Pod NetworkPolicy
        Â· The pod does not have a matching NetworkPolicy
            Create a NetworkPolicy that targets this pod to control who/what
            can communicate with this pod. Note, this feature needs to be
            supported by the CNI implementation used in the Kubernetes cluster
            to have an effect.
    [CRITICAL] Pod Probes
        Â· Container is missing a readinessProbe
            A readinessProbe should be used to indicate when the service is
            ready to receive traffic. Without it, the Pod is risking to receive
            traffic before it has booted. It's also used during rollouts, and
            can prevent downtime if a new version of the application is failing.

    [CRITICAL] Container Security Context User Group ID
        Â· backend-v1 -> Container has no configured security context
            Set securityContext to run the container in a more secure context.

        Â· backend-v1 -> Container has no configured security context
            Set securityContext to run the container in a more secure context.
    [WARNING] Deployment has host PodAntiAffinity
        Â· Deployment does not have a host podAntiAffinity set
            It's recommended to set a podAntiAffinity that stops multiple pods
            from a deployment from being scheduled on the same node. This
            increases availability in case the node becomes unavailable.
    [CRITICAL] Deployment targeted by HPA does not have replicas configured
        Â· The deployment is targeted by a HPA, but a static replica count is configured in the DeploymentSpec
            When replicas are both statically set and managed by the HPA, the
            replicas will be changed to the statically configured count when the
            spec is applied, even if the HPA wants the replica count to be
            higher.
    [CRITICAL] Deployment has PodDisruptionBudget
        Â· No matching PodDisruptionBudget was found
            It's recommended to define a PodDisruptionBudget to avoid
            unexpected downtime during Kubernetes maintenance operations, such
            as when draining a node.
